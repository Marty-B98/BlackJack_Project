# BlackJack_Project
Running the Code:
To run the code you must first download the zip folder from the main branch on Github and then extract the files into a document. From there, in Matlab navigate to the folder to which you extracted the code and run it.

Motivation:
As avid gamblers it only seemed right to create a mini casino so that we can experience Vegas in the United Kingdom. As Poker was to challenging and there are too many variants, we stuck with the 3 major games. Black Jack, Roulette and Slots. These games were complex enough to let us use the techniques and understanding from the assignment but also apply new knowledge from use of videos and tutorials on the MatLab website such as GUIâ€™s. The programme would let you pick between the 3 games on the main menu.
